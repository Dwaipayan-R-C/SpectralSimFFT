# Introduction
This project is developed by me and my colleague [Polina Shilikhina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/polina-shilikhina-61b28116a/) during a course at [IMTEK-Simulation](https://www.imtek.de/laboratories/simulation) under the supervision of Dr. Andreas Greiner (Assistants / group leaders at [University of freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de/)). This project mainly aims to implement Spectral simulation methods in solving partial differential equations like Rayleigh Benard heat convection. We use [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for the computation.

# Simulations
* Thermal propagation:<br/>
Here, a Rayleigh Benard  thermal propagation simulation is presented <br/>

* Velocity propagation at Different Rayleigh:<br/>
Here we aim to present how three components of velocity induced by non-linear temperature gradient flows with time at different Rayleigh number.<br/>

* Static Simulation:<br/>
Here, we present a steady state simulation.<br/>
